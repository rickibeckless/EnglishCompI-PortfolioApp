                                In a bold and daunting move, Brady United tactically targets a variety of civilians and 
                                those with military experience with three images. The series of images all strategically 
                                provoke the emotions reluctantly acquired, and cultivated, with each growing tragedy from 
                                gun violence. While all three photos published by Brady United each introduce Brady's 
                                message, they use different methods to target different audiences. The most energetic and 
                                thought provoking photo is unexpectedly a representation of a nightclub. A place synonymous 
                                with joy and entertainment, love and fun, memories and laughter—diluted by the heart 
                                stopping appearance of a casket.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Looking beyond the casket, the background is adorned with various shades and hues of red, 
                                white, and blue and a seemingly endless supply of detail. The advertisement's design and 
                                studious positions introduce a multitude of information—a picture truly worth a thousand 
                                words. To add to the energetic environment, the club space is adorned with an open dance 
                                floor, a stocked bar, and numerous disco balls that reflect shimmering light upon the 
                                scene. Though the background is captivating, the eye cannot help but return to the central 
                                focus.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Illuminated by the disco balls' angelic rays, the adult sized casket draped with the 
                                American flag tells a tale of several tragedies that routinely occur in civilian places. 
                                The casket being decorated with the American flag emphasizes the ads' theme. Assault 
                                weapons were first developed during World War II by German inventor Hugo Schmeisser as a 
                                part of the Soviet Unions' war efforts. As it was then and as it continues to be, assault 
                                weapons are made for military use during times of war and on battle fields. With the 
                                military casket, Brady's ad calls into question the reasoning of civilians having assault 
                                weapons in their homes and communities.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The choice of colors intensifies the impact. Dark, foreboding shades dominate the walls and 
                                floors, accentuating the brighter hues of the casket, and the disco balls. Highlighting the 
                                caskets reminder, the darker variety of the background contrasts with the brighter and more 
                                vivid colors on the casket. The deliberate use of red, white, and blue goes beyond mere 
                                patriotism; it taps into the collective conscience of a nation. Red, embodying passion and 
                                urgency, resonates with the response the creators aimed to evoke. White, typically associated 
                                with purity, here, stands as a stark reminder of innocence lost. Blue, often linked with 
                                stability, takes on a haunting quality, reminding the audience of the stability they may seek 
                                in the face of rampant violence.
                            </p>

                                Brady's series of casket images in civilian areas, are all audacious statements considering 
                                the vibrant history of American patriotism and the fight of citizens arguing for their Second 
                                Amendment right to bear arms. In the 232 years since the Bill of Rights was ratified, there 
                                have been more than one thousand challenges to not only the Second Amendment's meaning, but 
                                also its place in modern society.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In possibly the most significant case in which the meaning of the Second Amendment was 
                                confirmed and clarified, District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) led to the Supreme Court to 
                                affirm the Second Amendment to mean an individual has the right to possess firearms for 
                                self-defense within the home. With the ruling that each individual could possess firearms 
                                in their home, not without regulations, set into stone that trained military members were 
                                no longer the only ones that could possess firearms. A data collection ("Number of firearm 
                                deaths in the United States from 1990 to 2021") found there was around 1,110,298 shooting 
                                related deaths in America. In the ten years after the District of Columbia v. Heller case, 
                                deaths by firearms had risen by 17%.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Every detail of Brady's image is a carefully designed message. A noticeable feature of the 
                                photo is the multitude of disco balls, it's not a fashion sense but instead a symbol. Twenty-five 
                                is a powerful number to Brady's plan and the statistics they share. In an alarming statistic, 
                                the United States has a mass shooting rate twenty-five times higher than other developed 
                                countries. Relating directly to Brady's goal, the organization embodies the number by wanting 
                                to reduce gun violence by 25% before the year 2025.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In addition to the disco balls and it's statistics, the advertisement has multiple, but subtle, 
                                allusions of various tragic events from gun violence. Each detail crammed into the image make 
                                it appear spacious but also cramped, as each detail has a meaning and nothing is placed as a 
                                space filler. It almost feels suffocating to see the many different hints, but this allowed 
                                Brady to successfully capture the audiences' attention and make them want to further explore 
                                the deeper meanings.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The red bathroom in the upper left corner, acts as a poignant reminder of specific tragedies 
                                etched into our national consciousness. Whether a recall to the Pulse Nightclub Shooting or 
                                to countless other bathrooms where gun violence took place, the tales of the tragedies survivors 
                                and victims had to endure in them, are at the forefront of the audiences minds. It compels 
                                viewers to confront the harsh realities of society and question the urgency of change. This 
                                allusion, while subtle, acts as a bridge between the fictional narrative of the advertisement 
                                and a chilling truth of the United States. When recognizing these symbols, the audience engage 
                                not only with the advertisement but also with their own experiences and emotions that have come 
                                and gone from the continuity of mass shootings.

                                The Brady organization has roots that go back to 1974 when the National Council to Control Handguns 
                                was founded ("History of Brady"). In the coming years, the organization's name evolved as it 
                                grew. During Ronald Reagan's assassination attempt of 1981, White House Press Secretary Jim Brady 
                                was shot and sustained a head injury that impacted the rest of his life. With the renewed momentum 
                                in the fight against gun violence, Sarah and Jim Brady went through multiple challenges and various 
                                meetings with legislators in attempts to pass the Brady Bill. The Brady Bill was passed in 1993, 
                                which made it official that Brady Background Checks would be required for all firearm purchases. 
                                In 2000, the Boards of Trustees for Handgun Control and the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence were 
                                renamed to Brady Campaign to Prevent Handgun Violence and The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Almost fifty years after the National Council to Control Handguns was founded, and the seeds for 
                                Brady were planted, in 2023 Brady is still fighting for tougher gun control laws. In terms of 
                                Brady's stance on assault weapons, they stated, "These weapons are uniquely lethal, designed to 
                                kill as many people as possible, as quickly as possible." Brady's latest fight is to ban assault 
                                rifles, weapons of war, from civilian hands.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In 1994, the Federal Assault Weapons Ban (AWB) was passed as part of the Violent Crime Control and 
                                Law Enforcement Act of 1994. The AWB, which prohibited the manufacture, sale, and possession 
                                of certain semi-automatic firearms with military-style features, as well as large-capacity magazines, 
                                for civilian use, expired in 2004. Since the expiration, the rate of mass shootings increased more 
                                than 100%, though critiques and experts disagree on the exact percentage and whether it shows an 
                                accurate and fair judgement on the bans' effect.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In Brady's Nightclub gun control ad the audience is reminded of the consequences of the current lax 
                                laws regarding assault weapons. Before the advertisements audiences' eyes and mind have the 
                                chance to properly process the emotional horror of the sight of the casket induced, their eyes are 
                                drawn to the words beneath it. Spanning wider than the casket, though smaller in height, the words 
                                of action are shown in bold white. The capitalized statement isn't a logo or catch phrase as seen 
                                in most advertisements; instead, it is two short and clipped sentences: "ASSAULT WEAPONS WERE 
                                DESIGNED FOR WAR ZONES. NOT OUR COMMUNITIES." The words leave little to imagination or misinterpretation. 
                                Though brief, it evokes the same feelings of despair but courage, and helplessness but determination. 
                                Brady's use of capitalization is the equivalent of a person with a microphone standing before an 
                                audience commanding attention with their posture alone; or even someone standing before a pen-drop 
                                quiet room and speaking in an even tone that still manages to carry throughout. Either way, in ten 
                                words Brady managed to captivate their audience and induce a multitude of questions. The advertisement 
                                does not bite off more than it can chew by directly targeting all firearms, instead it focuses on 
                                Brady's main issue: assault weapons.

                                With the increase of civilian having access to assault weapons, the rates of mass shootings are on 
                                the rise, and civilians are exposed to war zones in their communities. Brady United's gun control 
                                ad is a poignant and emotionally charged piece that effectively utilizes symbolism, color, and rhetorical 
                                appeals to convey its message. By juxtaposing the celebratory atmosphere of a nightclub with the 
                                solemnity of a military funeral, the ad compels viewers to confront the harsh reality of gun violence 
                                in America. As a call to action, the ad encourages viewers to support the ban on assault weapons, 
                                emphasizing the urgent need for policy changes to prevent further tragedies and the creation of 
                                civilian soldiers in our communities.

                                Brady United's nightclub advertisement strategically provokes the emotions of 
                                both club-goers and individuals with military knowledge or background. To 
                                juxtaposition the vibrant, inviting atmosphere of a nightclub with the solemnity 
                                of a military funeral, the ad uses symbolism, colors, and emotional appeal. 
                                With this, the image creates a clear metaphor of the absurdity of civilians 
                                dying in a manner not unlike to trained military soldiers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The ad opens with a vivid portrayal of a nightclub - a place synonymous with 
                                joy and entertainment. With an energizing mix of dark and cool colors, the 
                                club space is adorned with disco balls, an open dance floor, and a stocked 
                                bar; all things promising a lively night out. In the midst of the scene, in 
                                the shimmering lights of numerous disco balls, an adult-sized casket lay. 
                                In a stark contrast between the energetic club setting, the somber casket 
                                immediately captures the audience's

                                attention, evoking a sense of unease 
                                and discomfort. The casket, the most important feature of the ad, is 
                                centered and takes up more viewpoint than the rest of the images. Having 
                                the military casket in a clearly civilian place evokes strong emotion as 
                                the death of a normal everyday civilian is compared to the likeness of a 
                                death caused by war.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The choice of colors intensifies the impact. Dark, foreboding shades dominate 
                                the walls and floors, accentuating the brighter hues of the casket, and the 
                                disco balls. With the casket draped in the American flag, the easily recognizable 
                                red, white, and blue draw the eye. The darker variety of the background compared 
                                to the brighter and more vivid colors on the casket, focuses attention on the 
                                central message: the tragedy of civilian deaths due to assault weapons is a 
                                casualty of war.

                                Within the carefully curated hues of this advertisement lies an expense of 
                                emotion and societal commentary. The dark, muted tones of the nightclub 
                                create a background of which the brighter shades of the casket and the 
                                American flag shine brilliantly. The deliberate use of red, white, and 
                                blue goes beyond mere patriotism; it taps into the collective conscience 
                                of a nation. Red, embodying passion and urgency, resonates with

                                the creators aimed to evoke. White, typically associated with purity, 
                                here, stands as a stark reminder of innocence lost. Blue, often linked 
                                with stability, takes on a haunting quality, reminding viewers of the 
                                stability they may seek in the face of rampant violence.

                                In each detail of the image is a message. Twenty-five is a powerful number, 
                                the disco balls aren't a fashion sense of the club, but instead a symbol. 
                                Firstly, it represents the alarming statistic that the United States has a 
                                mass shooting rate twenty-five times higher than other developed countries. 
                                The secondly and thirdly, it represents Brady United's desire to reduce gun 
                                violence by 25% by 2025.

                                Embedded within the advertisement are subtle allusions of real-world events, 
                                throughout there are multiple emphasis on the background images. Such as the 
                                red bathroom in the upper left corner, acts as a poignant reminder of a tragedy 
                                etched into our national consciousness. Whether a recall to the Pulse Nightclub 
                                Shooting or to countless other bathrooms where gun violence took place, the 
                                tales of the tragedies survivors and victims had to endure in them, are at 
                                the forefront of the audiences minds. It compels viewers to confront

                                realities of society and question the urgency of change. This allusion, while 
                                subtle, acts as a bridge between the fictional narrative of the advertisement 
                                and a chilling truth of the United States. When recognizing these symbols, the 
                                audience engage not only with the advertisement but also with their own 
                                experiences and emotions that have come and gone from the continuity of mass 
                                shootings.

                                are the words, "Assault weapons were designed for war zones. Not our communities." 
                                Amplifying the message of the military casket, this phrase, continues the 
                                repetition of  showing the similarities of mass shootings and war.
