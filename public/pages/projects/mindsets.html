                                Reflecting on my own achievements and shortcomings, I realize that my successes 
                                are deeply rooted in my failures. I cannot confidently declare my progress as 
                                accomplishments without having previously failed. While this is fundamental to 
                                almost every moment of progress and movement I've had in my life's journey, one 
                                prominent experience of this is my recent journey to becoming a Software Engineer. 
                                I am not yet a Software Engineer, not yet able to master more than web-based 
                                development—instead, I am a Student Web Developer. Even though I am not yet at 
                                my end goal, the ability to create websites within a week is an example of my 
                                growth and progress. Having begun not knowing the words or the definitions that 
                                are fundamental to my study, to understanding and explaining them, this can now 
                                be called progress—and because this is progress, it is also success. I've come to 
                                where I am on this path, and achieved what I have, only through the previous 
                                failures of each attempt to complete a goal. I failed, meaning I did not yet 
                                complete the requirements I'd set for myself, but after multiple attempts, I 
                                then succeeded. After each failed attempt of the correct implementation of 
                                JavaScript or C++, I try again. I look at different resources, I ask more 
                                questions, and through this, I learn more. While practice does not always make 
                                perfect, it does make progress. Throughout every attempt at success, the one 
                                thing they all have in common is trying. To begin something is to try; and 
                                continuation after failure is to try again.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Realizing these fundamentals, I began to wonder: What in the mind prompts the 
                                continuation of hope and movement towards success? What in the mind makes failure 
                                prompt termination and why is it so monumental to the decision of continuation of 
                                a journey and progress? Regardless, there is a clear prompt. Something encourages 
                                the mind, and something makes this encouragement present itself differently in 
                                each person. This is where Dr. Carol Dweck's introduction of "growth" and "fixed" 
                                mindsets allegedly gives a definition, reason, and solution to the proposed something. 
                                The problem: this seemingly simple reductionistic theory attempts to fill the 
                                massiveness of the thinking and workings of individual minds, without considering 
                                the many variations of the brain which can influence the mind. With recognition of 
                                neurodiversity, can Dr. Dweck's theory apply to more than the conventional person? 
                                If not, what are the possible ways to improve the inclusivity of the theory and 
                                incorporate those often overlooked?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As with most explorations, discovery starts on personal land, or mind in this case. 
                                Using eight simple questions and answers, Mindset Works' "What's My Mindset?" 
                                assessment attempts to diagnose the taker with a Fixed or Growth mindset, or a 
                                combination of the two. The short quiz offers six possible choices, beginning with 
                                "Disagree A Lot," and it decreases in certainty before increasing in agreement to 
                                "Agree A Lot." The assessment prompts responses to questions about the takers view 
                                on intelligence, whether it can grow and strengthen or if it is static and 
                                unchanging. Afterwards, the questions focus on how the taker responds to the 
                                different difficulties of work. It prompts critical thinking on how someone embodies 
                                the outcomes of their attempts and how that can affect their attitude towards 
                                further work and challenge.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After taking the assessment, I was not given an exact answer of either Fixed or 
                                Growth, but rather a mixture. In the assessment feedback, Mindset Works said, 
                                "You are moving toward a growth mindset, but there may be a few ideas holding 
                                you back from achieving all that you are capable of doing." While the length 
                                of the quiz gave away the lack of reliability and credibility of the results, 
                                the feedback is generous with its use of cautionary words that allow room for 
                                disagreement (probably, could, may, and if) without putting itself at risk of 
                                criticism. At first glance, right after completing the quiz and the result page 
                                loaded, I immediately denied the conclusion of being on my way towards a Growth 
                                mindset, as opposed to the Fixed mindset I'd grown to know, or the optimistic 
                                hopes of having already matured into a Growth mindset. But rereading the feedback 
                                and noticing the cautionary words and phrases made me reanalyze my perception 
                                of success and failure, and how that affects my daily motivation and the 
                                challenges I place myself in. Those words and their allowance for disagreement 
                                had me analyzing if and how the questions and the results could have been affected 
                                by my neurodiversity. While Mindset Works' assessment didn't directly address 
                                or include consideration of the large diversity that can affect ways of thinking 
                                and feeling, it did protect itself with the cautionary words which added a mock 
                                attempt of thoughtfulness.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Being neurodivergent and having a physical disability has resulted in me being wary 
                                of opinions involving growth in abilities and how inability should be viewed as a 
                                problem to be eventually solved. The majority of resources and research pertaining 
                                to "success versus failure" and "Growth versus Fixed mindsets" focuses on typicality. 
                                It's the "one-size-fits-all" of psychology, and just as with clothes, this is always 
                                false as "all" only means the societal archetype. As for those that do not fit into 
                                the archetype, they are often ignored, suppressed, and concealed. To evade these 
                                outcomes, some individuals try to conform to societal expectations. While some 
                                succeed in outwardly appearing to fit the mold, in my experience, the repercussions 
                                of this conformity can be detrimental to mental, emotional, and physical health.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The proliferation of this negative impact is accurately displayed in Nicole Lynn Lewis' 
                                "How Colleges Tell Student-Parents They Don't Belong." Lewis intertwines the college 
                                journey of student-parent Yoslin Amaya with her own similar story, revealing the 
                                detrimental effects of the notion and how it can quickly cascade. Lewis, the founder 
                                and CEO of Generation Hope, explores the phenomenon of the lack of acceptance of 
                                college students that are also parents, and the impact it has for those students' 
                                success. While this research and recognition of the struggles of student-parents 
                                is an important discussion, I also saw how relatable the mentioned struggles and 
                                hardships are to those that do not fit into the confines of yet another mold. While 
                                the metaphorical typical person of the archetype is often seen portrayed as the 
                                majority, Lewis continued to show examples of contrast with her statistics of college 
                                students. Regarding the college experience, Lewis said, "…74 percent of undergraduates 
                                in this country don't wholly fit that profile… This stereotype of the 'typical' 
                                college student is damaging, because it obscures the needs of those who don't fit 
                                that mold." When expecting everyone to fit the exact circumstances of a typical 
                                person, the majority of people are not represented. Exclusions of something seemingly 
                                small, such as recognition, can have consequences that cascade into major complications 
                                for those unthought of.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In another parallel I found between Lewis' depiction and the exclusion of the 
                                neurodiverse, Lewis described the ways of indirect oppression. Lewis said, 
                                "Sometimes the hurdles were subtle… Other times, the hurdles were so significant 
                                that they threatened my ability to stay enrolled." Her descriptions of the 
                                challenges that come with someone attempting to survive in an environment 
                                that is not equipped for them, are easily recognizable. She described the 
                                fear of revealing information to her professors as it had the possibility 
                                of compromising her opportunities of education. Adding to her fear of 
                                disclosing her identity of being a parent, Lewis said, "…the culture made 
                                clear that being a parent was an inconvenience that would not be accommodated." 
                                Her experience isn't relatable to only neurodiverse individuals, but to all 
                                people with disabilities, including myself. Discrimination of this type shows 
                                particularly in the workforce, as any mention or notice of differences can be 
                                seen as "undue hardship for the company." This view of hardship could hinder 
                                being hired during the interviewing process and keeping stable employment if 
                                hired. Even after securing a job, there is no guarantee that the employer

                                Regarding expected typicality, Lewis' article assessing the college environment seems 
                                to be a direct contrast to Mindset Works' mindset assessment. Where Lewis offers 
                                criticism to society only offering opportunities to a select few, Mindset Works did 
                                the opposite by promoting and participating in the notion of "one-size-fits-all." 
                                Mindset Works didn't present itself to have deliberately shown apparent disregard 
                                of those with diversities, but it did participate in the common ignorance of society. 
                                Even slight disregard and ignorance can quickly grow, leaving some of society's most 
                                vulnerable population without life-changing opportunities they could have seized 
                                with simple respect and acknowledgement of their existence. Both Lewis' criticism 
                                and Mindset Works' forgetfulness show the importance of questioning Dr. Dweck's 
                                Growth and Fixed mindset. Dweck's theory is so widespread and is frequently taught 
                                to present and future educators as advice on how to better help their students. 
                                School is one of the first places that a child, and the adults around them, begin 
                                to realize the differences between them and other children. Because of this, the 
                                importance of recognition and inclusion in a widely promoted teaching method that 
                                is seen as a "solution," becomes dire.

                                While Lewis sheds light on the challenges faced by underrepresented groups, particularly 
                                student-parents in the college environment, Surbhi Sachdev reiterates Dweck's theory 
                                by emphasizing the role of confidence in reshaping one's mindset and overcoming 
                                obstacles. In her Ted Talk, "The Power of a Growth Mindset", Sachdev focused on 
                                changing a mindset through confidence. She argued that the main hindrance preventing 
                                people from achieving their vision of success, is the lack of confidence and belief 
                                in self. After a brief mind exercise with the audience, Sachdev used the resulting 
                                conclusion to say, "…as individuals, we have a natural tendency to remain within our 
                                comfort zone." At the beginning of her presentation, she instructed the audience to 
                                raise their hands as high as they could, and then proceeded to ask them to raise their 
                                hands even higher. Despite being instructed to do so the first time, most of the audience 
                                were able to stretch their arms higher. To the phenomenon of people not performing 
                                to the best of their abilities, Sachdev said, "…this is not about our mindset… it's 
                                all about changing our mindset and how do we find that confidence back and how do we 
                                overcome those obstacles." She then went on to share her personal experience of the 
                                journey it took to eventually achieve her life's dreams. Her main point throughout 
                                the presentation is to admit to what she viewed as failures and setbacks, and to 
                                attribute them all to her limited mindset. Sachdev used her journey of going from 
                                Miss India Worldwide, to a dead-end job in administration, to forcing herself beyond 
                                what she was comfortable with and achieving her dreams and more.
                            </p>

                                Surbhi Sachdev almost made it sound easy. The first time I watched her presentation, 
                                I was impressed with all she'd achieved in less than a decade—and all through 
                                changing her mindset. While Sachdev avoids using the label of Growth mindset, her 
                                speech advocates for the adoption of the aspects associated with it. Her 
                                encouragement to expand beyond what is comfortable and known, is inspirational to 
                                those that have the choice in doing so. But as with Mindset Works' assessment, 
                                Sachdev did not account for those that don't have the choice to go beyond. I will 
                                give credit where it's due and say that her presentation was very motivating to try 
                                harder. It filled my mind with images of dreams long forgotten, hopes and wishes to 
                                shooting stars, and life plans written in crayon. The remembrance of those pleasures 
                                faded back into the box they came from when Sachdev concluded with, "…remember, what 
                                you truly believe is what you can achieve." I returned to where I am now and realized 
                                I can believe I can do anything, but that doesn't change the fact that I am physically 
                                incapable of achieving those beliefs.

                                So far, all of the sources have promoted Growth mindsets rather than Fixed, and now, 
                                finally I question the meaning and origin of the concept of Growth and Fixed mindsets. 
                                It's clear that these terms, or behaviors, are promoted as a path to success, but 
                                what does it mean to Dr. Carol Dweck, the psychologist who coined the term? 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In her article "Even Geniuses Work Hard," Dr. Dweck described her studies of how people 
                                learn and how it could help school-aged children. She presented the two mindsets 
                                and their differences, explaining, "Individuals with a fixed mindset believe that 
                                their intelligence is simply an inborn trait… In contrast, individuals with a growth 
                                mindset believe that they can develop their intelligence over time." To apply this 
                                to students, Dweck observed how they responded to challenges. Students that maintained 
                                their determination to solve challenging problems after initially struggling or failing, 
                                were identified as having Growth mindsets. In contrast, the students that did the 
                                opposite and instead avoided situations that might have made them struggle, were 
                                said to have Fixed mindsets. Throughout the article, those that wanted to continue 
                                work after setbacks, and therefore continue learning, were seen as the model students. 
                                In order for students to perform their best, Dweck urged teachers to incorporate 
                                encouragement of challenge into their classrooms. Concluding her article, she 
                                emphasized the importance of fostering a Growth mindset environment to bestow the 
                                students with the willingness to work through challenges and continue towards success.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As I read Dweck's article, I began to wonder whether she initially intended to explore 
                                only two mindsets in her research or if the discovery of these two mindsets shaped 
                                her narrative. Regardless, it raised additional questions about the breadth of her 
                                theory's applicability. Dweck's article focuses on the optimistic idea that anything 
                                can be achieved with the right mindset. This brings forth my first question: "Can Dr. 
                                Dweck's theory apply to more than the conventional person?" Notably, Dweck's research 
                                didn't explicitly mention whether any of the children studied were neurodivergent or 
                                had any other disabilities, suggesting a potential oversight or omission in addressing 
                                this crucial aspect. When conducting a study involving a diverse group of children and 
                                subsequently advocating for the application of the findings, the importance of 
                                inclusion becomes a major consideration. While I don't believe this was intentional, 
                                this oversight appears to be an aspect that might have warranted attention from a 
                                researcher and psychologist. Like the mindset assessment and the approach found in 
                                Sachdev's presentation, Dweck conveys a "can-do" attitude and promotes the ability to 
                                achieve anything if enough effort is applied.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A possible challenge and improvement to the "one-size-fits-all" mentality present in 
                                Dweck's theory could be found in Lisa Blackwell's article, "You Can Grow Your Brain." 
                                In contrast to the other articles, Blackwell presented evidence that the brain grows. 
                                While this information could possibly support Dweck's mindset theory, it also emphasizes 
                                the faults. Blackwell relates the brain to a muscle, saying, "It changes and gets 
                                stronger when you use it." She explained that neurons have the ability to grow and 
                                get stronger when someone learns new skills—the continuation of learning a new skill 
                                results in a stronger brain each time, meaning that performing the new skill gradually 
                                gets easier. Because of the constant growth a child's body does, it was previously 
                                thought that only children's brains could grow. But, with the help of studies of 
                                different animals and the human brain, it was found that an adult human's brain can 
                                and does also grow. Scientists explored this by performing a study of brain activity 
                                in adults who practiced a new skill and those that didn't. The study involved teaching 
                                Group I how to perform a skill while Group II remained untrained and unable to do the 
                                skill. Afterwards, the scientists compared brain scans of the two groups and found that 
                                Group I had greater brain activity, and therefore growth, in the visual and motor areas 
                                than Group II.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When relating Group I's brain activity growth to the ability of growth in other skills, 
                                Blackwell continued, "But it's not just about effort. You also need to learn skills 
                                that let you use your brain in a smarter way." She reiterated that the same applies 
                                to skills growth such as learning math. Just as Group I was unable to correctly 
                                perform the skill but eventually got better over time, those that deny their ability 
                                to learn math could also grow their brain. While Blackwell focuses on the claim that 
                                everyone can grow and improve a skill with practice, she clarifies, "This means that 
                                it's not just how much time and effort you put in to studying math, but whether when 
                                you study, you learn something new and hard." If the brain can physically grow and 
                                change, as this information suggests, it raises the question: In the physical sense, 
                                does everyone have the opportunity for growth in abilities and knowledge?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Blackwell's article was different from the others, focusing less on the mentality of a 
                                growth mindset, but instead on the physical implications learning can have. Her article 
                                repeatedly restated that the brain physically grows with implementation and exercise of 
                                a new skill. Where the other articles and presentations were on the edge of, "I did it 
                                and so can you," Blackwell incited further thought into being able to master a new skill. 
                                I took note of her insistence to use words like "skills" rather than "abilities." These 
                                two words may be used interchangeably, they have distinct meanings. A person can acquire 
                                a skill by continuously practicing the correct methods, but first that person must have 
                                the ability to perform the methods. An ability isn't something that is typically gained 
                                but instead something that is natural and inherent. In an obvious example, someone with 
                                two legs can learn to run a sprint by enhancing their running ability, while someone 
                                without legs cannot naturally enhance their running ability and therefore cannot 
                                naturally acquire the skill to run faster.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I purposely used the word "naturally" in respect for the many accommodations that may 
                                be accessible to a person with disabilities. At the end of her article, Blackwell 
                                said, "Sometimes it even hurts! But when you feel yourself get better and stronger, 
                                you realize that all the work is worth it!" Her statement could easily be taken the 
                                wrong way, but it's important to remember that Blackwell is specifically speaking of 
                                skills, rather than abilities. Concluding my search for answers with Blackwell's 
                                article proved to be fruitful in tempting me to reevaluate my initial processing of 
                                the previous sources. Where I'd previously judged the works of Mindset Works, Sachdev, 
                                and Dweck as being too bland and rigid, Blackwell's, "You Can Grow Your Brain" offered 
                                information that supported all the claims. Mindset Works' mindset assessment and 
                                Sachdev's presentation speak of skills rather than abilities. They encourage a change 
                                in the way a person approaches challenges and new skills, advising people to be more 
                                open and positive towards new opportunities and growth.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Viewing the sources in this new light caused me to, again, rethink my results from 
                                Mindset Works', "What's My Mindset" assessment. "You are moving toward a growth mindset, 
                                but there may be a few ideas holding you back from achieving all that you are capable of 
                                doing," the assessment feedback had said. It later stated, "A growth mindset is something 
                                that you can develop." As Dweck had clarified, the terms "Fixed" and "Growth" refer to a 
                                person's beliefs regarding the statis of their intelligence. Combining these with Blackwell's 
                                confirmation of brain activity and strengthening, I can narrow my view of my assessment 
                                of personal skills to exclude my abilities. Instead of reading the assessment feedback 
                                as being ignorant and dismissive of my abilities and limitations, I can read it as an 
                                encouragement of skills.

                                While often left unspoken, Growth and Fixed mindsets refer to skills. I'd asked, 
                                "Regardless of neurodiversity, can Dr. Dweck's theory apply to more than the 
                                conventional person?" and to that I found that the answer depends on how the 
                                theory is implemented. In a more negative than positive light, the terms are 
                                indifferent to abilities and don't necessarily apply to more than the conventional 
                                society archetype of a person. I find this primarily negative because it runs 
                                the very probable risk of sending an ill-informed message that any skill and 
                                ability can be gained with work and dedication. This invites discrimination against 
                                those who do not have the ability and do not have the accommodations to gain 
                                it. But Dweck's theory's lack of inherent inclusion could also be positive. 
                                It keeps a light note and provides inspiration and chance to those that are 
                                discouraged with their lack of progress and growth in a skill.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My second question serves as a response to the prompt of the first: "If not, what are 
                                the possible ways to improve the inclusivity of the theory and incorporate those often 
                                overlooked?" In relation to the negative of Dweck's theory, while these ambitious 
                                attitudes do not inherently include abilities, they don't exclude them either. To 
                                improve inclusivity, the application of Growth and Fixed mindsets could benefit from 
                                definitive distinction. When teaching and spreading the simplified distinction of how 
                                people approach intelligence, it should be strictly clarified that terms such as mindset, 
                                confidence, develop, and effort refer to skills rather than abilities.
                            </p>

                                Overall, after reviewing these sources, I understand Dr. Dweck's theory is not inherently 
                                inclusive but that doesn't disqualify the theory altogether. By modifying the different 
                                ways of implementing the proposed Growth and Fixed mindset modifications or strengthening,
                                Dweck's theory could grow in its intended audience and simultaneously spread awareness 
                                and promote the positivity of not only neurodiversity, but of all diversities of the mind, 
                                body, and brain.

                                Reflecting on my own achievements and shortcomings, I realize that my successes are 
                                deeply rooted in my failures. I cannot confidently declare my progress as accomplishments 
                                without having previously failed. While this is fundamental to almost every moment of 
                                progress and movement I've had in my life's journey, one prominent experience of this 
                                is my recent journey to becoming a Software Engineer. I am not yet a Software Engineer, 
                                but instead a Student Web Developer. Even though I am not at the end goal, this is growth 
                                and progress, and through progress, this is success. I've come to where I am on this path, 
                                and achieved what I have, only through the previous failures and shortcomings of each 
                                project and problem. I failed, meaning I did not yet complete the requirements I'd set 
                                for myself, but after multiple attempts, 
                                
                                <img src="../../imgs/projectImgs/roughImgs/mindsetRough1_2_2(1)Merge.jpg" alt="" class="rough-imgs">
                                
                                I then succeeded. After each failed attempt 
                                of the correct implementation of JavaScript or C++, I try again. I look at different 
                                resources, I ask more questions, and through this, I learn more. While practice does 
                                not always make perfect, it does make progress. Throughout every attempt at success, 
                                the one thing they all have in common is trying. To begin something is to try; and 
                                continuation after failure is to try again.
                            </p>

                                Realizing these fundamentals, I began to wonder, what are success and failure without 
                                each other? In the study of optics, it is determined that darkness is not a distinct 
                                state of being, but rather the lack of being of light and its energy. Replacing "light" 
                                with success, and "darkness" with failure, the question seems to answer itself. But 
                                this question on its own introduced more. What in the mind prompts the continuation 
                                of hope and movement towards success? What in the mind makes failure prompt termination 
                                and why is it so monumental to the decision of continuation of a journey and progress? 
                                
                                <img src="../../imgs/projectImgs/roughImgs/mindsetRough1_2.png" alt="" class="rough-imgs r-imgs-page">
                                
                                Regardless, there is a clear prompt. Something encourages the mind, and something makes 
                                this encouragement present itself differently in each person. This is where Dr. Carol 
                                Dweck's introduction of "growth" and "fixed" mindsets allegedly gives a definition, 
                                reason, and solution to the purposed something. The problem: this seemingly simple 
                                reductionistic theory attempts to fill the massiveness of the thinking and workings 
                                of individual minds, without considering the many variations of the brain which can 
                                influence the mind. Regardless of anatomical differences and neurodiversity of the 
                                body and brain, can Dr. Dweck's theory apply to more than the typical person? If not, 
                                what are the possible ways to improve the inclusivity of the theory to incorporate the 
                                major population of those frequently forgotten?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As with most explorations, discovery starts on personal land, or mind in this case. 
                                Using eight simple questions and answers, Mindset Works' "What's My Mindset?" assessment 
                                attempts to diagnose the taker with a Fixed or Growth mindset, or a combination of 
                                the two. The short quiz offers six possible choices, starting with "Disagree A Lot" 
                                it decreases in certainty before increasing in agreement through to "Agree A Lot." 
                                The assessment prompts responses to questions about the takers view on intelligence, 
                                whether it can grow and strengthen or if it is static and unchanging. Afterwards, 
                                the questions focus on how the taker responds to the different difficulties of work. 
                                It prompts critical thinking on how someone embodies the outcomes of their attempts 
                                and how that can affect their attitude towards further work and challenge.

                                After taking the assessment, I was not given an exact answer of either Fixed or Growth, 
                                but rather a mixture. In the assessment feedback, Mindset Works 
                                
                                <img src="../../imgs/projectImgs/roughImgs/mindsetRough1_2_2Merge.jpg" alt="" class="rough-imgs">
                                
                                said, "You are moving 
                                toward a growth mindset, but there may be a few ideas holding you back from achieving 
                                all that you are capable of doing." While the length of the quiz gave away the lack of 
                                reliability and credibility of the results, the feedback is generous with its use of 
                                cautionary words that allow room for disagreement (probably, could, may, and if) without 
                                putting itself at risk of criticism. At first glance, right after completing the quiz 
                                and the result page loaded, I immediately denied the conclusion of being on my way 
                                towards a Growth mindset, as opposed to the Fixed mindset I'd grown to know, or the 
                                optimistic hopes of a complete Growth mindset. But rereading the feedback and noticing 
                                the cautionary words and phrases made me reanalyze my perception of success and failure, 
                                and how that affects my daily motivation and the challenges I place myself in. While 
                                Mindset Works' assessment didn't directly address or include consideration of the large 
                                diversity that can affect ways of thinking and feeling, it did protect itself with the 
                                cautionary words which added a mock attempt of thoughtfulness.

                                The majority of resources and research pertaining to success versus failure and Growth 
                                versus Fixed mindsets focuses on typicality. It's the "one size fits all" of psychology, 
                                and just as with clothes, this is always false as "all" only means the typical, but 
                                perfect, person in that society. The proliferation of this notion is accurately displayed 
                                in Nicole Lynn Lewis' "How Colleges Tell Student-Parents They Don't Belong," where Lewis 
                                intertwines the college journey of student-parent Yoslin Amaya, with her own similar 
                                story. Lewis, the founder and CEO of Generation Hope, explores the phenomenon of the 
                                lack of acceptance of college students that are also parents, and the impact it has 
                                for those students' success. While this research and recognition of the struggles of 
                                student-parents is an important discussion, I also saw how 
                                
                                <img src="../../imgs/projectImgs/roughImgs/mindsetRoughP2mainCutMerge.jpg" alt="" class="rough-imgs r-imgs-page">

                                "typical, but perfect, person." While the metaphorical typical person is often seen 
                                portrayed as the majority, Lewis continues to show examples of contrast with her 
                                statistics of college students. Regarding the college experience, Lewis says, "…74

                                stereotype of the 'typical' college student is damaging, because it obscures the 
                                needs of those who don't fit that mold. While not yet a reading that incorporates Dr. 
                                Dweck's Growth and Fixed mindset theory, Lewis does provide interesting reasoning 
                                behind the need for inclusivity when discussing theories and ideologies.

                                After reviewing these seven sources, I've a better understanding of how Dr. Dweck's 
                                theory is not inherently inclusive but that doesn't disqualify the theory altogether. 
                                By modifying the different ways of implementing the purposed Growth and Fixed mindset 
                                modifications or strengthening, Dweck's theory could grow in its attended audience 
                                and simultaneously spread awareness and promote the positivity of anatomical 
                                differences and overall neurodiversity.
