                                In a combination of academia and technology, this portfolio reflects two 
                                distinct yet interconnected facets of my studies and hobbies. In the realm 
                                of education, English Composition I honed my practical writing skills. 
                                Meanwhile, in the world of development, I've crafted a user-friendly web 
                                platform that signifies a pivotal milestone in my web-development journey.

                                        English Composition I focused on the development of practical 
                                        writing skills throughout the semester. The primary focus was 
                                        on comprehending the utility of writing and reading as 
                                        functional tools. Considerable emphasis was placed on the 
                                        mechanics of writing, introducing a toolkit comprising flexible 
                                        strategies to enhance overall writing proficiency.

                                        The semester revolved around crafting three essays: one delving 
                                        into personal beliefs using the “This I Believe” structure, 
                                        another rhetorically analyzing the various details of an 
                                        advertisement, and an exploratory essay with a delayed thesis 
                                        exploring the dynamics of growth and fixed mindsets. These 
                                        assignments required a delicate balance between personal 
                                        conviction and effective articulation, prompting the adoption of 
                                        writing styles that provided thoughtful and seamless connection 
                                        with the intended audience.

                                        The front-end constitutes everything users see and interact with 
                                        on a website — buttons, images, and the overall layout. In contrast, 
                                        the back-end functions as the engine behind the scenes, managing 
                                        databases, processing data, and ensuring seamless interactions when 
                                        users submit forms or request information. Essentially, it oversees 
                                        the server-side operations, guaranteeing the website functions 
                                        correctly and delivers accurate information.

                                        I've designed this portfolio as a practical and user-friendly web 
                                        platform. The front-end is constructed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
                                        with a specific emphasis on responsiveness and accessibility. This 
                                        ensures a smooth experience for users across various devices, 
                                        prioritizing usability for as many people on as many devices as 
                                        possible.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        For the back-end, I've utilized JavaScript with Node.js and Express. 
                                        Through the implementation of routes and controllers, I've structured 
                                        the backend to enhance user experiences, incorporating features like 
                                        URL routing for effortless navigation.
                                    </p>

                                        This project marks a significant milestone, as it is my first website 
                                        that incorporates my proficiency in both user-experience and server 
                                        navigation. It was the push I needed to take a greater leap into my 
                                        journey of web development. There's no better way to improve than 
                                        through challenge; practice doesn't make perfect, but it does make 
                                        progress.

                                Hiya, I'm Ricki! I'm a first year student at Pulaski Tech, studying computer 
                                programming. 
                                <img src="../imgs/aboutImgs/fishTankImg.jpg" class="rb-about-img fish-about-img" alt="">
                                For the past three years I've been independently studying web development. 
                                It's been an up and down journey, but it's allowed me to delve into both 
                                front-end (how a webpage looks and acts) and back-end (how and where information 
                                is stored) technologies.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Creating this portfolio provided me with a fantastic opportunity to enhance 
                                my front-end and back-end development skills. My current goal is to become 
                                a full-stack web developer, creating and navigating both the visual elements 
                                of web design and the labyrinth of server-side development.

                                No matter how much I want to, I don't sit behind a desk all day. For that I 
                                thank my cat, La'Gaia, and my two dogs, Angel (Cane Corso) and Ace (Yorkie). 
                                Even if I wanted to ignore them and continue working, they'll just sit in my 
                                lap or yell at me.
