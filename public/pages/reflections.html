                                    The first essay assignment was a "This I Believe" essay, based on the essay series of the same 
                                    name. Tasked with constructing a narrative of a significant personally held belief, I dedicated 
                                    this assignment to a particular philosophy that has come to fruition in the past few years. "I 
                                    Live For Me" was an accurate title for the essay that compactly dictated my journey to living 
                                    for myself rather than for the approval and acceptance of others. The essay emphasizes the 
                                    realization that one's existence is not an indebted obligation but an opportunity for personal 
                                    growth and self-expression. The analogy of slowly deteriorating painted ceiling tiles served as 
                                    a metaphor for my perception of self as a mural shaped by my parents' assumed expectations. 
                                    "I Live For Me" concluded with a newfound perspective and encapsulated the view of personal growth 
                                    and change as enhancements rather than deviations from societal expectations.
                                </p>

                                    Throughout the duration of the assignment, I learned to utilize various methods to both encourage 
                                    and direct me towards a completed essay that was satisfactory to my standards. In my writing 
                                    process, I incorporated both simple methods to clear my mind of distraction and active writing 
                                    exercises to plan and begin the essay. After viewing and analyzing selections from the "This I 
                                    Believe" essays, but before I began to plan and prewrite, I educated myself on the principles of 
                                    MLA format and practiced implementation with blank documents, and mock sentences and paragraphs. 
                                </p>

                                    The prewriting and planning included exercises that applied various tones and themes to different 
                                    beliefs that appeared to meet the requirements of the assignment. This prewriting exercise is a 
                                    major process that I use in every writing I do, from poetry, fiction, and non-fiction. In these 
                                    short exercises, I give myself prompts with a range of topics, and respond to them using different 
                                    tones of writing. In a sense reflective to trying on different outfits, I practiced different 
                                    tones by alternating between writing past and present tense, formal and informal, serious and 
                                    humorous, and optimistic and pessimistic. For finding the style of writing I tested the use of 
                                    descriptive versus expository writing. After these exercises I felt equipped to select a topic, 
                                    tone, and style, and began to craft the rough draft, examine the given and received peer reviews, 
                                    and finally create my polished drafts.

                                    A rhetorical analysis of an advertisement served as the basis for the second essay. The chosen 
                                    advertisement had to meet the requirements of having been targeted towards an American audience 
                                    and developed in the past twenty years. The focus was on employing a rhetorical framework to 
                                    decipher the ad's features and assert a claim regarding its reflection of twenty-first-century 
                                    American values. After using various keywords in search for a suitable advertisement, I found 
                                    an ad by the gun control organization, Brady United. In my essay "Civilian Soldiers: Assault 
                                    Weapons in Society" I analyzed the advertisement for an assault weapon ban. The single image 
                                    was made remarkable by the prominent feature of the casket draped in an American Flag residing 
                                    in a nightclub. The rhetorical analysis essay examined the symbolism, color choices, and rhetorical 
                                    appeals used in the ad to convey a message and emotional impact of assault weapons on civilian life. 
                                    It discusses how the ad connects to historical events, legal battles, and the current fight for 
                                    stricter gun control laws.
                                </p>
                                <p class="l-c-c-text">
                                    Before I began planning and writing this essay, I first had to acquire an understanding that each 
                                    detail of the advertisement had significant meaning. Realizing that in a major project such as 
                                    Brady United's ad nothing was conveniently or ignorantly included, allowed for a deeper 
                                    understanding of the company that produced or endorsed it. In the assault weapon ban advertisement, 
                                    the included call-to-action words were not the only ways to decipher the intended meaning. By 
                                    observing and investigating the many background features and elements, I was able to see a story 
                                    greater than the two-dimensional photo. At the very least, the analysis required brief research 
                                    into the company and the topic of the advertisement. The rough draft included the bare minimum of 
                                    research, which resulted in me being extremely dissatisfied with the lack of substance included in 
                                    the essay. To grow the analyses, I began to investigate Brady United's ideals and goals more 
                                    thoroughly than before. Researching the company quickly became researching the founders and then 
                                    almost every side and background story I could find.
                                </p>

                                    After analyzing Brady United and their reasons for creating the advertisement, I began to research 
                                    the history of American gun control laws, the history of assault weapons, and various statistics of 
                                    the rates of gun violence and mass shootings. By researching as I did, the analysis was able to 
                                    relate to the audience of the essay, as well as Brady's intended audience of the advertisement.

                                <h4 class="reflection-subheader">Project Three</h4>
                                <p class="l-c-c-text">
                                    The third essay was an exploratory essay with a delayed-thesis which grew to be one of my favorite 
                                    writings as of yet. With this assignment, I attempted to reflect on my personal experiences and 
                                    explore the concept of Growth and Fixed mindsets, particularly in the context of Dr. Carol Dweck's 
                                    theory. By acknowledging the impact of failures on personal growth, I emphasized that success is 
                                    often intertwined with setbacks. "Growth and Fixed Mindsets: Exploring Their Relation to 
                                    Neurodiversity" delved into a discussion of whether Dweck's theory could be applied to a diverse 
                                    range of individuals, particularly focusing on those with neurodiversites and disabilities. Before 
                                    delving into the summaries and responses to the five sources, the assignment required an exploratory 
                                    question to be clearly stated after the personal and reflective introduction. With the complexity of 
                                    the subject explored, I felt it would be a better fit to ask two related questions rather than one.
                                </p>
                                <p class="l-c-c-text">
                                    After viewing the first of the required sources, "You Can Grow Your Brain" by Lisa Blackwell, I 
                                    found the direction and tone I wanted the essay to acquire. Deciding to critically approach the 
                                    Growth and Fixed mindset theory, I identified a problem, "…this seemingly simple reductionistic 
                                    theory attempts to fill the massiveness of the thinking and workings of individual minds, without 
                                    considering the many variations of the brain which can influence the mind." I questioned the 
                                    "one-size-fits-all" mentality and suggested that the theory, while promoting a positive attitude, 
                                    may inadvertently contribute to discrimination against those with limitations. The two questions I 
                                    asked served as pathways for which the problem could be dismissed or solved. I first asked a base 
                                    question, "With recognition of neurodiversity, can Dr. Dweck's theory apply to more than the 
                                    conventional person?" The second question was an extension of the first, "If not, what are the 
                                    possible ways to improve the inclusivity of the theory and incorporate those often overlooked?" 
                                    Its purpose was to balance out the critical exploration by looking for solutions to alleviate the 
                                    identified problem, if I found that it continued to persist throughout the duration of the 
                                    explorations. After the exploration and reflections, the essay concluded with the delayed-thesis 
                                    which served as a response to the two questions asked at the beginning.
                                </p>

                                    Similar to the writing process I'd gone through during the drafting of "I Live For Me", the planning 
                                    and prewriting for the exploratory essay began with finding and adjusting different writing tones and 
                                    styles. One of the first prewriting tasks assigned was to draft the first two paragraphs, the personal 
                                    introduction, of the essay as well as the exploratory questions. During this I initially attempted to 
                                    introduce the essay in a philosophical tone. The prewriting paragraphs used language that prompted the 
                                    audience to engage in self-reflection with a multitude of rhetorical questions that ranged from societal 
                                    and cultural beliefs to philosophical questions. After finding that the initial paragraph drafts didn't 
                                    fit into the identified problem, I began to review more of the assigned sources. As I'd decided to 
                                    completely change the course of my essay, I had to find more suitable sources. Going through the sources 
                                    I began to re-summarize them while attempting to view them in a different light. After doing this process, 
                                    sometimes doing so multiple times, I was able to find the five sources I would use that would suit my 
                                    critical analysis of Dweck's theory.

                                    Throughout this semester, I've learned how and why to assess the environment of a writing and

                                    explanations used. In the drafts of the first essay, "I Live For Me", this growth could be 
                                    observed through the evolution of descriptive language and details.

                                        I continually chanted, 'Momma's sacrificed so much,' like a constant, war-cry that'd become the 
                                        theme song of my days. I had to fix it; I couldn't live with myself knowing the burden I was on

                                    personal topics, the polished draft expanded on this topic by creating a dedicated paragraph that gave 
                                    context to my parents and my mindset.

                                    Critical thinking, reading, and composing were foundational to my progress in this course. During the 
                                    planning and writing of the second and third essays, "Civilian Soldiers: Assault Weapons in Society" 
                                    and "Growth and Fixed Mindsets: Exploring Their Relation to Neurodiversity", I was able to use 
                                    supporting readings and sources to form an understanding of the assigned topics. For both essays I 
                                    delved into research, synthesizing information from multiple sources to develop an informed opinion. 
                                    This process was a testament to the seamless integration of reading, inquiry, and communication in the 
                                    creation of a well-informed piece. In "Growth and Fixed Mindsets: Exploring Their Relation to 
                                    Neurodiversity", I utilized this skill to show fluctuations in opinions and progress towards answering

                                    disadvantages student-parents are presented with in colleges and universities, I was able to find

                                        environment that is not equipped for them, are easily recognizable."

                                    Another thing the second and third essays underscored was my ability to integrate original ideas with 
                                    those of others. An example could be seen in the third essay where I engaged with diverse sources to 
                                    weave together information and additional readings about or relating to Dr. Carol Dweck's Growth and 
                                    Fixed mindsets theory. Using MLA guidance, I've improved in my implementation of appropriately

                                    Before beginning this course, I tended to shy away from rough drafts and planning, instead opting for a 
                                    one-time writing approach. However, recognizing the value of iteration and refinement, I embraced the 
                                    practice of preplanning and then generating multiple drafts. Unlike high school, the prewriting techniques 
                                    taught in Composition I weren't requirements but instead suggestions to guide the development of personal 
                                    writing practices. Understanding this made me realize that planning and prewriting to some extent, even 
                                    just a paragraph, can go a long way to make the draft writing process smoother.

                                    Mentioned as a writing process for the first essay, trying on different themes, tones, and styles is a 
                                    major generation technique that I've gained. The integration of this method resulted in a more prewriting 
                                    than I'd previously thought I could tolerate and prevented my common practice of completely restarting a 
                                    writing piece after finding I no longer agreed with the tone or style.

                                    The system of peer reviewing was an effective method of reflection as it resulted in me gaining further 
                                    insight and understanding of assignment objectives. Reviewing the essays of classmates required a 
                                    transition into being a reader rather than the writer, which allowed me to recognize what I was missing, 
                                    doing incorrectly, or didn't like about my own essay. Receiving my reviewed essay had similar effects, 
                                    though the most notable advantage was criticism of sentences, transitions, and paragraphs that were 
                                    unclear. Understanding these faults resulted in me being able to further connect with the intended 
                                    audience. The emphasis on collaborative writing processes in this course significantly influenced my 
                                    approach to feedback and revision.

                                    A fluent essay is first formed on foundations that consist of a variety of writing pieces that form the 
                                    overall "feel." Incorporating revision of grammar, punctuation, and spelling, with bigger concerns such 
                                    as deviations of tones, allows for a comprehensive essay. When revising my essays, I first focus on the 
                                    bigger concerns, as they usually affect progression and readability. After assuring the essay transitions 
                                    and continues in an appropriate manner, I then assess the essays for small mistakes that have a lower 
                                    chance of interrupting audience attention, such as spelling, grammar, and formatting. Through these varied 
                                    writing tasks, I have cultivated a heightened awareness of conventions, contributing to the overall polish

                                    The strengths that I could identify in the polished drafts of all three projects are indicated as having 
                                    exhibited significant improvement from rough drafts and past writings. For the first essay, I was able to 
                                    showcase enhanced clarity and flow by delving into personal experiences with refined language and 
                                    emphasizing the theme of self-acceptance. The second essay, the rhetorical analysis, effectively engaged 
                                    the audience through vivid descriptions, introspective symbolism analysis, and a compelling investigation 
                                    of the ads call to action. Essay three displayed an improvement in organization and refined language which 
                                    contributed to an increasingly professional and engaging presentation. All the assignments aimed to display 
                                    my ability to reflect on feedback, leading to critical analysis and deeper insights into the respective 
                                    topics, and I believe that was achieved to satisfactory standards.

                                    Some common challenges I had with all the projects included having a significantly hard time effectively 
                                    transmitting my ideas and themes in a concise manner. One thing I had specifically challenged myself with 
                                    this semester was condensing my writing and language and attempting to adhere to the specified word 
                                    counts—or at least not overly exceeding them. Another challenge was my use of tone consistency throughout the 
                                    writings. I tend to "write as I talk", meaning my writing reflects the style in which I speak. When speaking, 
                                    my voice flits between volume, infliction, and variation in tone. I realize that this style of speaking 
                                    can sometimes make my intentions and meanings difficult to decipher to those I am speaking to. Similarly, 
                                    this style of writing impairs my ability to create smooth transitions between sentences, ideas, and 
                                    paragraphs. Specific to the second and third essays, improvement could be made by further balancing of the 
                                    evaluation of theories, introducing in-text citations, and providing concise explanations where needed as 
                                    these would enhance the overall quality and seamless readability.

                                <p class="l-c-c-text">
                                    Throughout the course, I've observed a remarkable growth in my writing skills and critical thinking 
                                    abilities, evident across the three distinct projects. Project 1, the "This I Believe" essay, 
                                    challenged me to construct a narrative with precision, emphasizing personal beliefs in a format 
                                    and description an unassociated audience could clearly follow and understand. In Project 2, the 
                                    Rhetorical Analysis essay, I honed my skills to perform a meticulous examination and illustration 
                                    of an advertisement from Brady United. Crafting this essay required a comprehensive exploration of 
                                    the rhetorical features and an assertion regarding their reflection of twenty-first-century American 
                                    values. The project strengthened my ability to convey complex ideas effectively. Project 3, the 
                                    Exploratory Essay, marked a notable shift toward research-driven exploration and delayed-thesis 
                                    composition. This project encouraged a deep dive into current research on failure, growth mindset, 
                                    and their implications. The varied genres and rhetorical situations covered in the course broadened
