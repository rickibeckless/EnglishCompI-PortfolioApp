                                Using metaphors of paintings, it illustrates a journey of self-love and acceptance.

                                For the longest time, my life revolved around living up to the expectations of others rather than myself. 
                                I'd come to realize that this form of life wasn't plausible and would only lead to disappointment. Though the 
                                journey I've had to embark to have this understanding wasn't conventional, it was a necessary lesson of 
                                self-acceptance and appreciation.

                                For the beginning years, I was a happy child who loved school and learning. My assignments were returned 
                                bearing bright red 'A+'s, and little smiley faces drawn in the corners. The teachers would say to me, "You 
                                must make your parents so proud!" I'd fill up with pride as they'd pat my back and give a positive call 
                                home. When I'd use good manners out in public the adults would say, "Your parents raised you so well!" 
                                or "If this is how you are, I'd love to meet your parents!" They always called me a 'shining star', but 
                                not in the sense of producing my own light. More as a moon, reflecting the brilliance of the real star and 
                                only basking in its borrowed glory.
                            </p>
                            <p id="pg-3">
                                As a child, the cause of the praise didn't matter, either produced or given, light is light. Whether someone 
                                looks at me for something I have done or because of how I represent my parents, matters none. Praise was 
                                praise, and I continually echoed in my mind, 'My parents must be so proud,' like a constant, reassuring mantra 
                                that played in the background of my thoughts. 
                            </p>
                            <p id="pg-4">
                                I was simply of my parents and was content with that. So, when it did happen, and the smiles slid off 
                                everyone's faces, the letters were bright red 'F's with frowny faces in the corners, I was acutely aware 
                                of the shift and what it meant. 
                            </p>
                            <p id="pg-5">
                                Instead of the teacher's praise, it was, "Is this how your parents raised you?" or "I thought you were 
                                better than this." This shift from the 'perfect' and 'teacher's pet' kid to the 'quiet' and 'let her be, 
                                I guess' kid formed the foundation of my spiraling mental state. It felt set in stone then; I was the failure 
                                of my parent's life. As I'd changed so significantly in such a short amount of time, everyone noticed. My 
                                middle-school teachers saw when I could no longer concentrate on doing my homework, and they saw when I'd 
                                finally stopped bothering to try at all. My high-school teachers saw when I could no longer sit in a classroom 
                                with the other students, and they saw when I'd given up and then stopped attending. I'd shifted from the bright 
                                child who got all 'A's and never had to attend summer school, to the failing child who couldn't even be graded 
                                and had to attend court.
                            </p>

                                My parents were never the type to require an abundance of discipline and success, but it was expected of me. 
                                Because that's what I did, it was who I was. I was the child whose report card they didn't have to check 
                                and whose parent teacher conferences they didn't have to attend. Seeing how bad I'd gotten and living through 
                                everyone's anguished faces, I began to despise myself. The only requirement my parents ever gave me was to 
                                "Just try," and "Live and enjoy life," and I couldn't even do that. I'd gotten it into my head that it was 
                                up to me to avenge my parents' image and name from my own tarnish by doing away with everything that had gone 
                                wrong. This felt like an impossible task as 'everything that had gone wrong' seemed to be every piece of my 
                                being. Everything I had grown into as a young adult was wrong and caused undue hardship to my parents, teachers, 
                                and fellow classmates. They deserved better, and I continually chanted, 'Momma's sacrificed so much,' like a 
                                constant, war-cry that'd become the theme song of my days. I had to fix it; I couldn't live with myself knowing 
                                the burden I was on everyone. After exhaustively exploring every possible solution to just fix myself, and 
                                finding no lasting resolutions, I resigned myself to a life of emptiness and made the difficult decision to 
                                distance myself from family and any other possibility of kinship.
                            </p>

                                To me, it was a normal thought process, one that I'd believed everyone held: 'You live for your parents, 
                                your existence costs them years of money, time, and energy. Show them how sorry you are. Get rich and buy 
                                them a house.' The challenges to this belief came in unlikely ways and from unexpected places. In the heat of 
                                it all, one shining beacon of hope amidst the darkness of the lowest moments of one's life—a hospital.

                                It wasn't a happy place, but a necessary one. The whole building smelled of stale cleaning supplies and 
                                years old urine that'd seeped into unreachable nooks and crannies. There were murals painted onto the ceiling, 
                                most chipped and some unintelligible. They held words of hope and encouragement, Bible verses, brightly colored 
                                paintings of hills and suns. The illusion of healing, now forgotten and dull after their placement a few years 
                                before. No one upkept or attempted to preserve them, and other than the small and heartless reprimands to those 
                                who'd climbed the chairs to reach, no one paid them any mind. In that heartless building, with its steel gates 
                                and locked doors, the other children and I were taught, we were not to touch the hard work of others. Don't 
                                throw things at them, don't rub them, don't touch it, because we'd break it.

                                I felt similar to those ceiling tiles, in the fact that I was also just the product of another that should 
                                not be touched, especially by my own hands. To add anything of myself would be to ruin it, to cause 
                                irreparable damage and trouble. That ceiling, with its shift from beauty to ruin and no hope of renewal, 
                                was a significant reminder of my own position. Trip after trip, the ceiling and I stayed the same—no 
                                additions, no removals, and no improvements. We were alike in being frozen in time. Doing nothing other 
                                than desperately wishing for someone to redo us, but knowing we could only wait for someone to destroy us.

                                When someone's hands were caught nearing the painted ceiling, we were quick to apologize and resume our 
                                seats after the adults would quip, "Hey, do you know how dirty your hands are?" or "Stop touching the 
                                ceiling, they worked very hard on those." They said it as if our hands were the cause of the decay 
                                instead of the mere presence of time. It felt foreboding, a fortune being laid out upon the ceiling. 
                                A promise of insignificance, of just being another thing to be wilted away by time.

                                For a long time, I believed myself to be nothing more than a mural. An image of a person's hard work, 
                                left on a ceiling to be gawked at once and then forgotten. A painting my hands should not touch, lest 
                                I chip and smudge away at my mother and father's hard work. Aren't I just a reflection of my parents' 
                                hard work? Everything I do, every move I make, an echo of my parents' sacrifices and struggles. To be 
                                as I am, to exist as I do, is a shameful acknowledgment of my parents' trials. My parents, the people 
                                that went from trailers and sickly apartments to a beautiful house with a beautiful family. My mother, 
                                a magical and mesmerizing woman that's gone through each and every trial with a smile on her face, 
                                daily prayers, and a blessing ready to be uttered. My inability to be successful, to "Just try," and 
                                "Live and enjoy life," was a mere mockery of the lives they'd built themselves.

                                It is true that lessons on the self and its place among others are quickly learned and understood within 
                                those early ages of life. Some are taught that they are the beginnings of a beautiful multidimensional 
                                art. Free to enhance and grow as they please, because they are not the result of completed art, but the 
                                foundations and tools to create it. Others are taught they are nothing more than a mere vessel carelessly 
                                placed on land to please others. They grow to understand they are the display for their parents' completed 
                                art, and they are not to change or modify anything lest they break it.

                                depression gave me. It wasn't until my last time there that something changed. From a simple offhand

                                While looking at those ceiling tiles and feeling the connection between my stilted life and its motionless 
                                hills, the first person to challenge the belief was Miss Dominique. It was a simple declaration, thrown out 
                                almost offhandedly, but had started a crusade of wonder. "You know… you don't owe them anything, right?" 
                                she'd asked. Her brow was creased as if she was having trouble seeing from my point of view. As if knowing 
                                to exist for yourself was the default option every person chose. This lady in her fall scented office, gave 
                                a small laugh with just the barest hint of humor, "For one, you didn't ask to be born. They decided that. 
                                They asked for this."
                            </p>
                            <p id="pg-16">
                                For a moment we just stared at each other, maybe she was thinking she'd crossed a boundary and just as 
                                she'd started to elaborate, her office transformed. No longer did it smell merely of fall, but it smelled 
                                of cinnamon and fallen pinecones. Of pumpkins, sugar, and spice. It smelled of a day younger me walked 
                                outside to jump in a pile of fall leaves. Of a day a little girl had experienced back when she was happy.

                                Could it have been that simple? I don't owe them anything? Do my parents really not expect me to be a 
                                perfect, well-rounded, successful woman at the age of eighteen, nineteen, twenty-five, or even forty? 
                                Those murals on the ceiling tiles, did the artists not expect their beauty to last forever, but instead 
                                anticipate the additions of personality?

                                Coming from Miss Dominique, at first, it seemed too good to be true. There were spikes of doubt going 
                                through my mind. 'Maybe she only said that because she was paid to do so,' I told myself. Though no 
                                matter how hard I tried, I couldn't deny the logic presented before me. I am the result of my parents, 
                                who are the result of their parents' parents. When I look at Momma and Daddy, I not only see their mothers 
                                and fathers, but also the result of time and progress. After Miss Dominique's words, I began to look at the 
                                ceiling tiles as the product of their artists and of their time. When I look into the mirror now, I see my 
                                parents and my progress.

                                I believe, I live for me. I do not owe anyone anything in my existence. I am a beautiful mural with an 
                                outline painted by those before me. Each wear, tear, and addition can only be an enhancement. Yes, things 
                                have spiraled, and expectations have shifted and left. But that's just fine. All I have to work on is me, 
                                for me. Nothing more, for no one else.

                                For the longest time, my life revolved around living up to the expectations 
                                of others rather than myself. I've come to realize that this form of life 
                                wasn't plausible and would only lead to disappointment. Though the journey 
                                I had to embark to have this understanding wasn't conventional, it was a 
                                necessary lesson.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For the beginning years, I was a happy child who loved school and learning. 
                                My assignments were returned bearing bright red 'A+'s, and little smiley 
                                faces drawn in the corners. The teachers would say to me, "You must make 
                                your parents so proud!" I'd fill up with pride as they'd pat my back and 
                                give a positive call home.

                                When I'd use good manners out in public the 
                                adults would say, "Your parents raised you so well!" or "If this is how 
                                you are, I'd love to meet your parents!" They always called me a 'shining 
                                star', but not in the sense of producing my own light. More as a moon, 
                                reflecting the brilliance of the real star and only basking in its borrowed 
                                glory.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As a child, the cause of the praise didn't matter, either produced or given, 
                                light is light. Whether someone looks at me for something I have done or 
                                because of how I represent my parents, matters none. Praise was praise, and 
                                I continually echoed in my mind, 'My parents must be so proud,' like a 
                                constant, reassuring mantra that played in the background of my thoughts. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I was simply of them and content with that. So, when it did happen, and the 
                                smiles slid off their faces, the letters were bright red 'F's with frowny 
                                faces in the corners, I was acutely aware of the shift and what it meant.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Instead of the teacher's praise, it was, "Is this how your parents raised you?" 
                                or "I thought you were better than this." This shift from the 'perfect' and 
                                'teacher's pet' kid to the 'quiet' and 'let her be, I guess' kid formed the 
                                foundation of my spiraling mental state. It felt set in stone then; I was the 
                                failure of my parent's life. I'd gotten it into my head that it was up to me 
                                to avenge my parent's image and name from my own tarnish by doing away with 
                                everything that had gone wrong. This felt like an impossible task as 'everything 
                                that had gone wrong' seemed to be every piece of my being. Everything I had 
                                grown into as a young adult was wrong and caused undue hardship to my parents, 
                                teachers, and fellow classmates. They deserved better, and I continually chanted, 
                                'Momma's sacrificed so much,' like a constant, war-cry that'd become the theme 
                                song of my days. I had to fix it; I couldn't live with myself knowing the burden 
                                I was on everyone.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To me, it was a normal thought process, one that I'd believed everyone held. 
                                'You live for your parents, your existence cost them years of money, time, 
                                and energy. Show them how sorry you are. Get rich and buy them a house.' The 
                                challenges to this belief came in unlikely ways and from unexpected places. 
                                In the heat of it all, two shining beacons of hope amidst the darkness of the 
                                lowest moments of one's life—a hospital.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It wasn't a happy place, but a necessary one. The whole building smelled of 
                                stale cleaning supplies and years old urine that'd seeped into unreachable 
                                nooks and crannies. There were murals painted onto the ceiling, most chipped 
                                and some unintelligible. They held words of hope and encouragement, Bible 
                                verses, brightly colored paintings of hills and suns. The illusion of healing, 
                                now forgotten and dull after their placement a few years before.

                                No one upkept 
                                or attempted to preserve them, and other than the small and heartless reprimands 
                                to those who'd climbed the chairs to reach, no one paid them any mind. In that 
                                heartless building, with its steel gates and locked doors, we were not to touch 
                                the hard work of others.
                            </p>

                                I felt similar to those ceiling tiles, in the fact that I was also just the 
                                product of another that should not be touched, especially by my own hands. 
                                To add anything of myself would be to ruin it, to cause irreparable damage 
                                and trouble. That ceiling was a significant reminder of my own position. 
                                Trip after trip, the ceiling stayed the same—no additions, no removals, 
                                and no improvements. Like me, it was frozen in time, doing nothing other 
                                than waiting for someone to destroy it. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When our hands were caught nearing the painted ceiling, we were quick to apologize 
                                and resume our seats after the adults would quip, "Hey, do you know how dirty your 
                                hands are?" or "Stop touching the ceiling, they worked very hard on those." They 
                                said it as if our hands were the cause of the decay instead of the mere presence 
                                of time. It felt foreboding, a fortune being laid out upon the ceiling. A promise 
                                of insignificance, of just being another thing to be wilted away by time.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For a long time, I believed myself to be nothing more than a mural. An image 
                                of a person's hard work, left on a ceiling to be gawked at once and then 
                                forgotten. A painting my hands should not touch, lest I chip and smudge away 
                                at my mother and father's hard work. Aren't I just a reflection of my parents' 
                                hard work? Everything I do, every move I make, an echo of my parents' sacrifices 
                                and struggles. To be as I am, to exist as I do, is a shameful acknowledgment 
                                of my parents' trials. My inability to be successful is a mere mockery of their 
                                intelligence.

                                It is true that lessons on the self and its place among others are quickly learned 
                                and understood within those early ages of life. Some are taught that they are the 
                                beginnings of a beautiful multidimensional art. Free to enhance and grow as they 
                                please, because they are not the result of completed art, but the foundations and 
                                tools to create it. Others are taught they are nothing more than a mere vessel 
                                carelessly placed on land to please others. They grow to understand they are the 
                                display for their parents' completed art, and they are not to change or modify 
                                anything lest they break it.

                                I was there again and again, but it wasn't until my last time there that something 
                                changed. From an offhand comment, I realized something that is now a core philosophy 
                                of my life.

                                At almost eighteen, it seemed every plan I had finally gotten the courage to 
                                make was crushed. I wasn't supposed to be there again, not that time nor the 
                                time before that. The first time was supposed to be the last time I stepped 
                                foot into that building.

                                Failures in each aspect of my life seemed to happen 
                                at all corners. Every person in my life seemed to be coming to reluctant terms 
                                with the fact that I was in a downward decline and every optimistic expectation 
                                that was usually thrown my way was halted.

                                life and its motionless hills, the first person to challenge the belief was Miss 
                                Dominique. It was a simple declaration, thrown out almost offhandedly, but had 
                                started a crusade of wonder. "You know… you don't owe them anything, right?" 
                                she'd asked. Her brow was creased as if she was having trouble seeing from my point 
                                of view. As if knowing to exist for yourself was the default option every person 
                                chose. This lady in her fall scented office, gave a small laugh with just the barest 
                                hint of humor, "For one, you didn't ask to be born. They decided that. They asked 
                                for this."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For a moment we just stared at each other, maybe she was thinking she'd crossed 
                                a boundary and just as she'd started to elaborate, her office transformed. No 
                                longer did it smell merely of fall, but it smelled of cinnamon and fallen 
                                pinecones. Of pumpkins, sugar, and spice. It smelled of a day younger me 
                                walked outside to jump in a pile of fall leaves. Of a day a little girl had 
                                experienced back when she was happy.

                                Could it have been that simple? I don't owe them anything? Do my parents really 
                                not expect me to be a perfect, well-rounded, successful woman at the age of 
                                eighteen, nineteen, twenty-five, or even forty? Those murals on the ceiling 
                                tiles, did the artists not expect their beauty to last forever, but instead 
                                anticipate the additions of personality?

                                Coming from Miss Dominique, at first, it seemed too good to be true. There were 
                                spikes of doubt going through my mind. 'Maybe she only said that because she was 
                                paid to do so,' I told myself. Though no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't deny 
                                the logic presented before me. I am the result of my parents, who are the result 
                                of their parents' parents. When I look at Momma and Daddy, I not only see their 
                                mothers and fathers, but also the result of time and progress. After Miss 
                                Dominique's words, I began to look at the ceiling tiles as the product of their 
                                artists and of their time. When I look into the mirror now, I see my parents and 
                                my progress.

                                I believe, I live for me. I do not owe anyone anything in my existence. I am a 
                                beautiful mural with an outline painted by those before me. Each wear, tear, 
                                and addition can only be an enhancement. Yes, things have spiraled, and 
                                expectations have shifted and left. But that's just fine. All I have to work 
                                on is me, for me. Nothing more, for no one else.
